Several main functionalities: . | Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases) | Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches) | Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes) | Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing) | Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing) | .

    "content": "Also can be called fault-tolerant/resilient. Fault is not same as failure. A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when a system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user. It is impossible to make possibility of fault zero. Therefore, it is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failure. Hardware Faults . | Mean time to failure (MTTF) of hard disk is 10 - 50y. | Add redundancy to the individual hardware components in a system. | However thereâ€™s a move towar systems that can tolerate the loss of entire machines, e.g. several nodes in a cluster. | This requires software technique in preference of in addition to hardware redundancy. | . | . Software errors . Human errors . | Design systems in a way that minimizes opportunities for error. | Decouple the places where people make the most mistakes from the places where they can cause failures. | Test thoroughly at all levels, from unit tests to whole-system integration tests and manual tests. | Allow quick and easy recovery from human errors, to minimize the impact in the case of a failure. | Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrics and error rates. | Implement good management practices and training. | .
